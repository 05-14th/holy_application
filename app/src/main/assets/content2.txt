Sign of the Cross: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

The Apostles Creed: I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord,
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting. Amen.

Our Father , Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

3 times: Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death Amen.

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.

Fatima Prayer: O My Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell and lead all souls to Heaven, especially those who are in most need of Thy mercy.

 

1) AGONY IN THE GARDEN: Jesus sweats blood in the garden the night before he was killed.

Dear Jesus, You lived 33 years among us, knowing what would happen to You, and yet You kept going, You had power You could have used to avoid this much suffering but You accepted it all to save us. You sweated blood thinking of how You would die so horribly the next day. In Your agony You asked Your Father to take away the suffering, but brought Yourself back quickly, and asked Him to let His Will, not Yours,  be done in You. Help me to also want God's Will, Your will, to be done in my life, not mine. Teach me how to control myself even when I know I can change a situation; give me the strength to do what is right in the eyes of God alone. Forgive me my sins that caused You that much pain, and thank You for loving me so much.

Our Father...

2) SCOURGING AT THE PILLAR: Jesus is badly beaten at the Pillar  

Dear Jesus, I am so sorry that one for whom You gave Your life, betrayed You. You were beaten up so badly, they tore up Your skin, they didn't have mercy on You, and they hurt You just to please themselves. You have done nothing to deserve such punishment, yet You willingly accepted for my sake. Please dear Jesus, help me to love You, to appreciate You, and never allow me to complain about injustice done to me, but to love beyond the cross.

3) THE CROWNING OF THORNS:  Jesus was crowned with thorns after being beaten. 

My Dear King, You were mocked after they beat You, and crowned You with thorns and yet You are the TRUE King. With the pain and humiliation You felt, You didn't respond to anything unkindly. You did what Your human strength allowed, without uttering a word of insult or complaint, or using Your Godly power. You had me and my brothers and sisters instead to defend and protect. Hoping we would listen to Your warnings, accept Your sacrifice and make a better choice to be with You one day in a paradise forever. Help me to remain in truth, to support truth and acknowledge truth even when I am wrong. Allow me to trust You, to accept my sufferings and offer them to You, and never let my sufferings make me do wrong. Help me to forgive always and never strike back.  You are the just judge, You will defend me.

Our Father...

4) CARRYING OF THE CROSS: Jesus was given a heavy cross to carry after being beaten and crowned with thorns. 

Dear Jesus, You carried the cross over the wounds of the beatings and thorns. I am so sorry for what You had to go through. You fell down many times, at the heaviness of Your cross and You rose again. Dear Jesus, You are the most loving being that ever lived, You took all that willingly, for me and everyone else. It was not a quick death, they tortured You all day, and You still remained kind. You met Your Mother on the way which gave You strength to have Her support but also pain to see Her suffering so badly. Teach me to love Her and to love You. Mother Mary, You who saw everything, thank Him for me, kiss His scars for me, and remind him that despite my sins I love Him dearly.

Our Father...

5) DYING ON THE CROSS: Jesus was hanged on the cross and died. 

Dear Jesus, Before You died You forgave those who killed You, teaching us to forgive without measure. In the middle of such crushing pain, You gave us Your Mother Mary to also be our Mother so she could comfort us as she comforted You. Please continue to remind me of the heavy price You paid for me so I can remember this all my life; remind me to obey You and help me to remember every word You said and try to put it in practice. Like the thief on Your right side, I am not worthy for heaven but please remember me when I get to Your kingdom and have mercy on all sinners.

Our Father...

Glory be...

Fatima Prayer: O My Jesus...

Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy! Our life, our sweetness, and our hope! To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve, to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley, of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us; and after this our exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb Jesus; O clement, O loving, O sweet virgin Mary.
Pray for us, O holy Mother of God That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Memorare: Remember O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided.
Inspired with this confidence, I fly unto thee O Virgin of Virgins and Mother of us all.
To thee do I come. Before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful.
O mother of the world incarnate, despise not my petitions but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.

Final Prayer: Let us pray. O God, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating upon these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.

Sign of the Cross: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

Dear father,
Forgive me for all my sins.
I thank you for all that you have blessed me with, even when I donâ€™t deserve it.
My body is currently in pain, my lungs are not working as they used to
Fill them with your love oh lord, remove all that is making me sick.
Restore my health and that of all who are sick.
Forgive me for the countless times I have let you down father.
I need you father!

Amen

Dear God,

Thank you for this new day and all of the blessings it brings. We ask for your guidance and presence as we go about our daily tasks and responsibilities. Please give us the strength and resilience to face whatever challenges may come our way, and help us to be a source of love and support for those around us.

We pray for your protection and care for all those in need, and for your wisdom and discernment to guide us in making good choices. We trust in your love and care for us, and we pray for your continued presence in our lives.

Amen.

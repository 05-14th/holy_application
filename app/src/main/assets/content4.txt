Sign of the Cross: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

The Apostles Creed: I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord,
Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into Hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting. Amen.

Our Father , Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

3 times: Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death Amen.

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.

Fatima Prayer: O My Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell and lead all souls to Heaven, especially those who are in most need of Thy mercy.


1) RESURRECTION: Jesus is resurrected after 3 days in the tomb. 

Dear Jesus, You resurrected after 3 days in the tomb as You have said You would. And when You resurrected You didn't make any fanfare and did not boast of Your Power to all those who had doubted You. In all humility and simplicity You did what You had to without showing off. You taught us simplicity, and that all that matters is to seek Your approval patiently with love in our hearts; to do our tasks in simplicity no matter how huge they are, and to avoid judging others. You told us that we will know a tree by its fruits. You also comforted us in trusting every word You said by resurrecting as You prophesied. Please help the whole humanity to know who saved them and who to trust. You love us so much and You want us to trust You fully and be under Your protection.  We have a God who is so powerful and capable to resolve all our problems, no one should leave in fear or desperation. You are more than capable. Please bring joy into a world that is so sad and lost.  Bring peace and comfort to the troubled.

Our Father...

2) ASCENSION: Jesus went back to heaven, rising in front of His disciples. 

Dear Jesus, You resurrected as you prophesied and You went back to heaven in front of Your disciples. What is most touching, is that before You rose from earth You comforted Your disciples and told them that You are not leaving them alone but You are going to prepare a place for them so they can join You later to live eternally happy. You sent them to spread the good news that You are the way, the truth and the life. That the one who believes in You shall not die and will be eternally happy. And You cared to remind them that You will send them the Holy Spirit to strengthen them in the mission You have given them. I thank You for that, as when we think we are alone, tired, or not capable, You have thought about everything we will need and You provide it for us. We love You Jesus and we want to fully trust You and love You more. Please give us the strength necessary to see, to love you, and to be Your messengers among Your children in the world so we can continue to help You save the world.

3) DESCENT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT: The Holy Spirit comes down on the disciples on Pentecost. 

Dear Jesus, You went back to celebrate your accomplishment on earth, saving us and living back in Your paradise. But You didn't forget our little strengths. You kept Your promise to send the Holy Spirit to Your disciples. Sending the Holy Spirit to all of us who will need His help and strength. Today the Holy Spirit is still with us, especially when we need Him for clarity, to enlighten the way, to love ourselves and love one another, to heal us in soul and body, to help us to understand God's ways etc. Dear Jesus, please send me the Holy Spirit, to help me in many needs of my heart, those I am aware of and those I am not aware of.

Our Father...

4) THE ASSUMPTION: Mary goes back to heaven body and soul.

Dear Blessed Virgin Mary, You have pleased God so much in your life. You have done His Will to perfection, and because You have been placed nearest to the Holy Trinity. You were chosen to be Jesus' Mother because You were so pure. You never condemned anyone, You never said a bad word about anyone. You always wanted to help those in need, protect their dignity and reputation. You are our perfect model on how to live this life and how to love God and others to the best. Please Mother Mary, who was given to us to be our own Mother, teach us how to be like You, to make good choices in our lives to follow God's ways. Pray for us so that we have enough discernment to recognize the truth. More than anything so many people are broken by so much injustice, lack of love, loneliness, rejection etc... please awaken our hearts to know how much God loves us, how much you love us. You said in the past that if we knew how much we are loved, we would cry out for joy. Our hearts have been so hardened, we don't feel it as it is. Pray for us Our Dear Mother.

Our Father...

5) CORONATION OF MARY AS QUEEN OF HEAVEN AND EARTH: Mary becomes the queen of heaven and earth. 

Dear Blessed Virgin Mary, You became the queen of heaven and earth as a reward of how you lived Your life so lovingly and purely. Oh Mother, we know everyone who lives their lives lovingly and correctly will also find so much joy in heaven, eternally. You are now our Mother and our Queen, which make us princesses and princes! Mother, why do we even ever worry about anything when we have the one who loves us this much, and who can give us whatever we ask for? But Mother what we need most is love and light in this world, please convey our pleas to Jesus to continue to give them to us, as He will never say no to You. Pray for us as You always do and open our hearts to the truth of the love of God for us and help us to love Him back and appreciate Him. We love You.

Our Father...

10 Hail Mary's 

Glory be...

Fatima Prayer: O My Jesus...

Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy! Our life, our sweetness, and our hope! To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve, to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley, of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us; and after this our exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb Jesus; O clement, O loving, O sweet virgin Mary.
Pray for us, O holy Mother of God That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Memorare: Remember O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided.
Inspired with this confidence, I fly unto thee O Virgin of Virgins and Mother of us all.
To thee do I come. Before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful.
O Mother of the world incarnate, despise not my petitions but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.

Final Prayer: Let us pray. O God, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating upon these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.

Sign of the Cross: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

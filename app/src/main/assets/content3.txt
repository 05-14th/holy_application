Sign of the Cross: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

The Apostles Creed: I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into Hell; on the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting. Amen.

Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

3 times: Hail Mary full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed are thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus. Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death Amen.

Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

Fatima Prayer: O My Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell and lead all souls to Heaven, especially those who are in most need of Thy mercy.


1) THE BAPTISM: Jesus asks John The Baptist to baptize Him.

Dear Jesus, You showed us how important our sacraments are by getting baptized Yourself even if you didn't need it. You were one with the Father always. At the baptism, God the Father spoke from heaven, saying "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased"!

Jesus, You are the Way, Truth and the Life, help me to see Your light and have the wisdom and courage to follow You.

2) WEDDING AT CANA: Jesus changed water into wine at the wedding at Cana

Dear Jesus, Your Mother told You about the need for wine at the wedding. You advised her it was not yet the time for You to perform miracles, but out of compassion and love for Your mother, You performed a miracle by changing water into wine, simply because She asked. You changed water into wine, not just any wine but the best wine, better than what they had before and You did it privately. People were surprised that the host of the wedding served better wine at the end. My dear Jesus grant me the grace to see the role of Mary in my life, to ask Her for help when I am in need. Because You love Her so much, She loves me just as much as a mother. You know the desires of my heart. You easily changed water into wine, so I trust that You can change my sorrow into joy, and my failures into triumph. With the assistance of Your mother Mary I need You to help me to seek to please You first, to live a peaceful life, to be a loving hand that reaches out to my brothers and sisters always, and all else that pleases You will be added to me.

3) PROCLAMATION OF THE KINGDOM: Jesus began to preach and continued to do so for 3 years. 

Dear Jesus, You left Your heaven, Your paradise to come to live with us, to come to teach us, no matter how high the cost to You, the suffering You would go through. You accepted it so You could teach me how to love and live a life detached from earthly good so I could earn a place in heaven and live eternally happy.  Thank You for everything You did for us. Please give me the humility to be able to listen to You and understand what You mean.

4) TRANSFIGURATION: Jesus is transformed into dazzling light in front of the Apostles Peter, John and James. 

Dear Jesus, You called Peter, James and John to go with You on the mountain, when You got there, You transformed into light, then Elijah and Moses appeared beside You. Peter was so surprised and felt he joy of heaven and asked if yJesus ou could all stay there. Then the voice of God said again, "this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased! Listen to Him"! Jesus, what a joy it is to be with You! What touched my heart is that You did this to strengthen the disciples for what was going to follow. You knew You would be beaten up, tortured and  shamed, yet You willingly submitted yourself without resistance.  Facing all of that, You were able to spare a thought for your disciples who You knew may be confused when they witness the horror that You faced, especially Peter, the one you chose to be the rock on which you would build Your church. Thank You for understanding our weaknesses, please help me to never deny You, to see You in everyone, to feel Your presence always. Help me to be patient with myself when I need it. Help me to be humble enough to rely on Your guidance in this life always.

Our Father...

5) INSTITUTION OF THE EUCHARIST:  Jesus instructed us to share the bread and wine in memory of Him. 

Dear Jesus, before You were put to death You still had to remember to give us the Eucharist through which You would remain with us eternally because You loved us that much. At the table where You shared Your heritage with us, was Judas who would betray You and Peter who would deny You. Yet You didn't push anyone away, You didn't exclude anyone from taking part in Your gifts. Thank you, and please help me to love everyone, to be fair in all I do, and to love You and see You in the Eucharist.

Fatima Prayer: O My Jesus...

Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy! Our life, our sweetness, and our hope! To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve, to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley, of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us; and after this our exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb Jesus; O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
Pray for us, O holy Mother of God That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Memorare: Remember O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided. Inspired with this confidence, I fly unto thee O virgin of virgins and mother.To thee do I come. Before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful.
O mother of the world incarnate, despise not my petitions but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.

Final Prayer: Let us pray. O God, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating upon these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.

Sign of the Cross: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

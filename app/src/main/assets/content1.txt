Sign of the Cross: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

The Apostles' Creed:
I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.

Our Father:
Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

Hail Mary (3 times):
Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

Glory Be:
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

Fatima Prayer:
O My Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell, and lead all souls to Heaven, especially those who are in most need of Thy mercy.

1) Annunciation:
Angel Gabriel tells Mary she will conceive the child Jesus.

Dear Mary, when the angel gave You a message that God wanted You to conceive Jesus our Savior, You said yes to Him without questioning Your well-being. You were engaged to Joseph, You knew you could be stoned to death, You knew people would not like You, but You trusted God fully because You knew that He knows better and has Your best interest at heart no matter what happens. Even if You would suffer. Pray for me too, that I may be humble like You and accept God's Will in my life, no matter what that is. Also, pray for me that I may have the discernment to know His Will and to live as a reflection of His commandments, especially the greatest of all Jesus left us, "Love God above all, and my neighbor as I love myself."

2) Visitation:
Mary visits her cousin Elizabeth.

Dear Mary, even though You were pregnant, You rushed to go to help Your cousin Elizabeth who needed more help. Despite Your cousin being older, she knelt before You, calling you "Blessed Among Women," honored that the Mother of God would visit her. Dear Mother, teach me to love like You and remind me and the whole world how much You love us, how much God the Father and Jesus the Son love us.

3) The Birth of Jesus:
Jesus is born in Bethlehem.

Dear Jesus, You were born in a poor place because hotels couldn't give Your Mother and St. Joseph a place to have You. Even though You were Almighty and the Son of God the Father, You didn't push or impose Your power. You were born among the poor who welcomed You in a stable with the Shepherds. Please dear Jesus, help me to be simple and gentle like You and God the Father. Help me never to impose my will, power, or strength on others. Help me to respect others, especially the poor. Mother Mary, who had a baby in such an uncomfortable place, remind me to be calm no matter what turbulence I might find in this life.

4) Presentation in the Temple:
Jesus is brought by His Mother and Father to be blessed in the temple.

Dear Jesus, You respected the culture of blessings for children, and You inspired Your parents to do the same as everyone else, even though You were God Himself. Through the prayer of the Rosary, I am constantly reminded about Your simplicity and Your deep love for me and all of us. You came to live among us and became like us to teach us to live this life. Please help me to know how to love You back and to appreciate the sacrifice You made to leave Heaven and come to Earth. Teach me to respect the law of my country and my church even when I feel opposed.

5) Finding Jesus in the Temple:
Jesus was lost for 3 days in the temple.

Dear Jesus, You stayed behind in the temple, preaching about Your Father, and three days went by even though You wanted to be with Your Mother and Father. You knew that You came on a mission to serve Your Father and earn souls for heaven. Help me to put God first in my life, in my work, even when things are not going as I wish. Mother Mary, pray for me that I know how to deal with pain as graciously as you did in your life, and please help me to find and imitate Jesus in all that I do, that I may do everything with unselfish love.

Hail, Holy Queen:
Hail, holy Queen, Mother of Mercy! Our life, our sweetness, and our hope! To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve, to thee do we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn, then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this our exile show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

Memorare:
Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary, that never was it known that anyone who fled to thy protection, implored thy help, or sought thine intercession was left unaided. Inspired with this confidence, I fly unto thee, O Virgin of Virgins and Mother of us all. To thee do I come. Before thee, I stand, sinful and sorrowful. O Mother of the world incarnate, despise not my petitions but in thy mercy hear and answer me. Amen.

Final Prayer:
Let us pray. O God, whose only begotten Son, by His life, death, and resurrection, has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life, grant, we beseech Thee, that meditating upon these mysteries of the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain and obtain what they promise, through the same Christ Our Lord. Amen.

Sign of the Cross: In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
